# Mouse Cursor Control Using Facial Movements -----> HandiCont

This HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) application in Python(3.6) will allow you to control your mouse cursor with your facial movements, works with just your 
regular webcam. Its hands-free, no wearable hardware or sensors needed.

# Our System Explanation

Our system is real time which captures a movement of mouse cursor through face detection and facial features. It overcomes the existing system by avoiding the use 
of external hardware that caused serious eye damages. It uses a template matching method for eye extraction instead of using hardware, even as in previous system 
the short blinks of eyes were avoided or neglected. In this system the hard blink is only used for selecting particular file or folder .With eye detection itâ€™s 
first aim is to captured face for the movement of mouse cursor. Then it reacts as the mouse does.

Goal of the system :

1. Hands-free mouse controlling
2. To establish vision based system
3. Controlling mouse motions using facial gesture
4. To eliminating the limitations of stationary head
5. To provide real time eye tracking
